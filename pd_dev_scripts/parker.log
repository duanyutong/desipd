Engineering and less common commands:
   offset                     Position of star relative to N4 CCD center
   boreset [ccd-id]           Position of star relative to boresight
                                 Default ccd-id is S4
   tim     <expnum> [maxoff]  Compute TELRA, TELDEC offset of image center
   focus                      Measure a focus sequence
   nick      <expnum>         Estimate 5-sigma limiting mag
   seeing                     Measure a single star

Useful commands:
   data                       cd to DECam data directory
   inventory [n]              List frames from n days ago (default 0)
      inv      [n]            (abbreviation for above)
      invPrint [n]            (Print to file)
   load    <expnum> [ccd-id]  Display one CCD (defaut is S4)
   bigload <expnum>           Display mosaic of all CCDs
   center  <expnum> [maxoff]  Compute RA, DEC, offset of image center
                                (default maxoff is 1024 pix)
   pdu       <expnum>         List PDU header (type q to quit)
   seeingall <expnum>         Measure mean seeing for an exposure
   psc       <expnum> <cat>   Measure seeing, clouds, sky, pointing
                                (takes a while to run)
   noiseCheck <expnum>        Check for electronic noise in overscan
       (In all of above, if expnum is blank, use most recent)
   ned                        Look up a galaxy in NED
   simbad                     Look up a star in SIMBAD
   skyview                    Look up a field in skyview
   ephem                      Print out sunset, twilight, moon times
   standards <UT>             (DES only) Find 3 standards to observe at UT
                                (be sure to use UT, not local time!)
   pointing [--help]          Display DES footprint progress.
   flatCheck [n]              Check of dome flats from n days ago (default 0)
